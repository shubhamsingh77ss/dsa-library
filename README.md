# dsa-library
A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations including Arrays, Searching, Sorting, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs
# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++  

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental *Data Structures* and *Algorithms* in *C++*.  
It is organized topic-wise (Arrays, Searching, Sorting, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs), with clean code, explanations, and complexity analysis.  
📌 Topics Covered  
# 1. Arrays
   - 1D Array problems  
   - 2D Array problems  
# 2. Searching
   - Linear Search  
   - Binary Search  
# 3. Sorting
   - Bubble Sort  
   - Selection Sort  
# 4. Stack & Queue
   - Stack (Array + Linked List implementation)  
   - Queue (Linear, Circular, Deque)  
# 5. Linked List
   - Singly Linked List  
   - Doubly Linked List  
   - Circular Linked List  
# 6. Trees
   - Binary Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS)  
   - Binary Search Tree (BST)  
   - AVL Tree  
# 7. Graphs
   - Graph Representations (Adjacency List & Matrix)  
   - BFS, DFS  
   - Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
## 🧑‍💻 Conventions  

- Each file contains:  
  - Algorithm name  
  - Approach / Explanation  
  - Time & Space Complexity  
  - Example test case (main function)
