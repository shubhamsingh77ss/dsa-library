It is organized topic-wise (Arrays, Searching, Sorting, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs), with clean code, explanations, and complexity analysis.  
📌 Topics Covered  
# 1. Arrays
   - 1D Array problems  
   - 2D Array problems  
# 2. Searching
   - Linear Search  
   - Binary Search  
# 3. Sorting
   - Bubble Sort  
   - Selection Sort  
# 4. Stack & Queue
   - Stack (Array + Linked List implementation)  
   - Queue (Linear, Circular, Deque)  
# 5. Linked List
   - Singly Linked List  
   - Doubly Linked List  
   - Circular Linked List  
# 6. Trees
   - Binary Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS)  
   - Binary Search Tree (BST)  
   - AVL Tree  
# 7. Graphs
   - Graph Representations (Adjacency List & Matrix)  
   - BFS, DFS  
   - Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
## 🧑‍💻 Conventions  
- Each file contains:  
  - Algorithm name  
  - Approach / Explanation  
  - Time & Space Complexity  
  - Example test case (main function)
 
## 📌 Roadmap  

- ✅ Arrays (1D, 2D)  
- ✅ Searching (Linear, Binary)  
- ✅ Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)  
- ⬜ Stack & Queue (all types)  
- ⬜ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- ⬜ Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)  
- ⬜ Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST)  
- ⬜ Advanced (Hashing, Heap, DP Basics)
